Loan Default Prediction using Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning Tools for Application in Financial Industry- Training based on Fictitious Data   

Problem:#
*Predicting Customer Loan Defaults Using AI Algorithms for a Fictitious 'Shantanu Bank of Singapore'*

Problem :#
Introduction: In the past, trust-based assessment through enquiries is qualified for approval of loans in Singapore especially for housing, car and education. The problem at hand is to shift from traditional method of loan approval to a robust reliable loan default prediction system based approval.

Statement:To develop AI models to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan for a fictitious 'Shantanu Bank of Singapore. This is crucial for any financial institution to minimize the (1) risk exposure and make (2) informed lending decisions.

Dataset: The dataset contains historical data for the past 10 years which includes customer's financial information, employment status, and previous loan repayment history.

Business Goals:#
Risk Mitigation: The primary objective is to reduce the risk of financial losses for the lending institution by accurately identifying customers who are more likely to default on their loans. This will help in minimizing bad loans and associated losses.

Improved Decision-Making: Enable the lending institution to make more informed and data-driven decisions when approving or denying loan applications. This leads to better allocation of resources and improved profitability.

Customer-Centric Approach: Ensure fair lending practices by assessing the creditworthiness of customers objectively, rather than relying solely on traditional metrics or subjective judgments.

Cost Reduction: By reducing the number of bad loans and defaults, the institution can save on collection and legal costs associated with loan recovery.

By addressing these business goals, the lending institution can build a reliable loan default prediction system that not only reduces financial risk but also enhances its reputation and competitiveness in the market.

Solution Steps#
To successfully solve or mitigate the problem of predicting customer loan default using machine learning algorithms, we should broadly consider the following aspects:

1. Data Collection:
Gather historical loan data collected over a period of 10 years, which includs borrower information such as income, location and whether loans were repaid or defaulted. Ensure data privacy and compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).

2. Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing data through imputation or removal. Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding). Normalize or standardize numerical features for consistent scales. Address class imbalance issues if present (oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation). 

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze the distribution of features and their relationships. Identify potential patterns, correlations, and outliers. Visualize data to gain insights. Use EDA to inform feature selection and engineering. 

4. Feature Selection/Engineering:

Select relevant features that influence loan defaults. Create new features if they add predictive value. Ensure ethical considerations in feature selection to avoid discriminatory practices. 

5. Model Selection/ Training/Tuning and Evaluation

Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms. Consider ensemble methods to improve model performance. Ensure model interpretability and explainability.

Train machine learning models on the training dataset. Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance using techniques like grid search or random search.

Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, confusion matrix) but F1-Score is suitable for imbalance classifications.
